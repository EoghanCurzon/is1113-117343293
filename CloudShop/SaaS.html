        <h2 class="subheading">What is Software as a Service?<h2/>
        <p1>
            Software as a service (or SaaS) is a way of delivering centrally hosted applications over the Internet as a service. SaaS applications are sometimes called web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software. Whatever the name, SaaS applications run on a SaaS providers servers.

Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management. The provider manages access to the application, including security, availability, and performance. SaaS business applications are usually accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser.
