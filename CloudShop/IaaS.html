        <h2 class="subheading">What is Infrastructure as a Service?<h2/>
        <p1>
           Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the Internet. Quickly scale up and down with demand, and pay only for what you use.

IaaS helps you avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing your own physical servers and other datacenter infrastructure. Each resource is offered as a separate service component, and you only need to rent a particular one for as long as you need it. We manage the infrastructure, while you purchase, install, configure, and manage your own software-operating systems, middleware, and applications.

        <h2 class="subheading">Advantages of IaaS:</h2>
        <p2>
            1. Eliminates capital expense and reduces ongoing cost; IaaS sidesteps the upfront expense of setting up and managing an on-site datacenter, making it an economical option for start-ups and businesses testing new ideas.
            <br/>
            2. Improves business continuity and disaster recovery; Achieving high availability, business continuity, and disaster recovery is expensive, since it requires a significant amount of technology and staff. But with the right service level agreement (SLA) in place, IaaS can reduce this cost and access applications and data as usual during a disaster or outage.
            <br/>
            3. Innovate rapidly; As soon as you've decided to launch a new product or initiative, the necessary computing infrastructure can be ready in minutes or hours, rather than the days or weeks, and sometimes months, it could take to set up internally.
            <br/>
            4. Respond quicker to shifting business conditions; IaaS enables you to quickly scale up resources to accommodate spikes in demand for your application, during the holidays, for example, then scale resources back down again when activity decreases to save money.
            <br/>
            5. Increase stability, reliability, and supportability; With IaaS there's no need to maintain and upgrade software and hardware or troubleshoot equipment problems. With the appropriate agreement in place, the service provider assures that your infrastructure is reliable and meets SLAs.
