        <h2 class="subheading">Advantages of PaaS:</h2>
        <p2>
            PaaS provides a huge benefit for companies adopting a microservices architecture, since PaaS allows for each microservice to be deployed and managed faster. PaaS is especially helpful when microservices are built using several different language and frameworks.
