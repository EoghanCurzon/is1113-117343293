            1. High adoption
            <br/>
            2. Lower initial costs
            <br/>

            <br/>
            4. Seamless integration.
            <br/>
            SaaS facilitates remote application hosting and delivery, making this the key advantage of SaaS: painless application access. SaaS customers have no hardware or software to buy, install, maintain, or update. Access to applications is easyâ€”you just need an Internet connection.
